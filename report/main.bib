% This file is called bibtex.
% It is a reusable list of reference entries that look like textual database.
% A program called bibtex processes this file and creates a file called main.bbl
% based on which citations are actually used in the paper.

% Citation command \cite emits information on which references are used and how
% they are referred to, replacing user-given identifiers such as DBLP:books/daglib/0072139
% with the inline citation according to a specified citation style (defined in variout .bst files).
% The bibliography command then uses information on what was cited to typeset
% a bibliography, again according to the .bst citation style.

% The entry below is copied verbatim from the biburl link below.
% Among simplest ways to create bibtex entries is to find it in dblp database.
% One way is to type in your search engine: dblp "Paper title"
